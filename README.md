# JavaImpl



This repository contains Java implementations and tests / driver code for any concepts which might be covered in a data structures or algorithms course. 

---

Many of these concepts are already implemented by standard librarys and all are certainly implemented elsewhere.
However, this should be a useful resource for anyone who wants to familiarize themself with data structures, algorithms or the Java language. 

---

## Implemented

- Integer Stack & Unit Tests
- Integer Binary Search & Unit Tests
---

## TODO:
Fix environment issues so repo can be cloned properly.

### Data structures
- ArrayList
- LinkedList
- StringBuilder
- Stack (Generic)
- Queue
- PriorityQueue
- Deque
- Heap
- HashSet
- HashTable
- BinaryTree
- RedBlackTree
- Trie / PrefixTree
- Balanced Search Tree
- 2 3 Tree
- AVL Tree?
- Graphs*

*Graphs will have their own section

### Algorithms

- Median of Medians QuickSelect
- Counting Sort
- String sorts

### Graphs
- Graph using adjacency list
- Graph using adjacency matrix
- Graph using ordered pairs

- Undirected graph
- Directed graph
- Directed acyclical graph (DAG)

- DFS for each graph representation
- BFS for each graph representation
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- Bellman Ford Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
- Kruskal's algorithm
- Minimum spanning tree

### Miscellaneous
- Recursion
- Memoization / Dynamic programming
- P / NP completeness
- Linear runtime solutions to NP complete problems... Just kidding!

### Algorithms problems
- Edit distance
- Knapsack problem
- 8 Queens problem
- Traveling salesman
- Longest path


As TODO list shrinks, will search data structures/ algorithms resources for additional concepts which may be of interest.
